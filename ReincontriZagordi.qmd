## Where I've been

::: incremental
-   PhD \@ SISSA, Trieste
-   Postdoc \@ ETH Zurich (physically in Basel)
-   Staff scientist \@ University of Zurich (this time in Zurich)
-   Data scientist \@ Vodafone Italia, Milan
-   (in the meanwhile, a couple of private initiatives)
:::

## PhD \@ SISSA, Trieste {background-image="images/trieste.jpg"}

## Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP): at the interface of physics and theoretical CS

![Science, 2002](images/science-2002.png)

## My PhD thesis: applications in computational biology

-   Gene regulatory network
-   Haplotype inference
-   Bonus: (yet another) clustering algorithm
-   Overall, **inspired** by biology, not really **in** biology

## What did I learn?

::: incremental
-   Trieste is not so close to Trento, after all
-   PhD is a journey, not a destination (semi-quote)
-   Bayes rule
-   Working across disciplines is fun...
-   ... but risky (in both ways)

## Reconstruction of viral populations from (noisy) DNA sequencing

![](images/shorah.png)

By the way, this is unsupervised learning

## Probabilistic model for read generation

![](images/diri_equation.png)

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{r}: \textrm{reads}\\
\mathbf{h}: \textrm{haplotypes, true viral sequences}\\
\mathbf{c}: \textrm{assignment of reads to haplotypes}\\
\end{align}
```

## Application: drug resistance mutations on HIV

Still around despite being \>10 years old

## What did I learn? (II)

::: incremental
-   a few things on HIV and its therapy
-   Bayes rule (just can't get enough)
-   mixture models (like Dirichlet Process Mixture)
-   a few programming tricks
-   that it takes a lot of effort to write help pages

## Above all, a bunch of statistics

## Institute of Medical Virology

I work in the diagnostics unit (and I become the "computational and data guy"
in the whole institute).

--

My job is to provide the computational algorithms and infrastructure to
switch from the "old" sequencing technology to to the new one.

--

Less research, more development

## Two flavours of viral populations

1. HIV as above (HCV too): there is a specific virus, you want to know
exactly how it looks like
2. Metagenomics: what virus is in there?

## What did I learn? (III)

::: incremental
- The most common question a biologist asks a "statistics" person
- The names of **all** different viral species that can infect humans 
- Ok, that was a joke
- HCV can be sexually transmitted
- The effect that methadone and needle and syringe programmes had in Zurich
- Many of the things that have been in the news in the past ~3 years
:::

## Change

:::incremental
- From Switzerland back to Italy
- From virology to "business"
- From academia to corporate

Team Big Data in Vodafone Italia as senior data scientist

## What do we do?

We support marketing with our analysis, translating a business problem
into an algorithm (typically a machine learning model)

## Examples

- When will a customer cease to be a customer?
- What drives them to leave us?
- What is the product they are most likely to buy and at what price?
- Are they satisfied with our products?
- If not why?

And all abiding by strict privacy rules

## How do we do this?

First, talking to colleagues

--

Collecting, curating, investigating, transforming, and finally analysing data

## What am I learning? (IV)

::: incremental
- Data you need **never, ever, ever** come in the shape you would like
- Big companies truly are complex systems
- Working in a company is very much a team work
- Who does what is probably the most difficult part to solve
